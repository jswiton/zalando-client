<div>
	<p>The only down side is that it runs this directive for all anchor tags.</p>
	<p>So if you have a lot of anchor tags on the page and you only want to prevent the default behavior for a small number of them, then this directive isn't very efficient. However, I almost always want to preventDefault, so I use this directive all over in my AngularJS apps.</p>
